** Some examples of sorting algorithms: **
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort etc

### Big O
Also called Landau's symbol, is a symbolism used in complexity theory,
computer science, and mathematics to describe the asymptotic behavior
of functions.

**Notation**
* O(1)
* O(log(n))
* O(n)
